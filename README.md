# ExtPlane #

This is a pre-compiled version of ExtPlane from https://github.com/vranki/ExtPlane.git
It is only available for Windows, but can be built for Linux and OSX if 
needed.

This pre-compiled version is needed to support XPlaneCDU, which 
requires the latest bug fixes from the master branch.

You should extract the ZIP file and copy ExtPlane-Master-MinGW-23Jan2018 
into your X-Plane 11 Resources/plugins directory. This directory should 
contain various DLL and XPL files, and no extra sub-directories.

XPlaneCDU is available from Google Play for Android devices from:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.waynepiekarski.xplanecdu

The source code for XPlaneCDU is available from:
https://github.com/waynepiekarski/XPlaneCDU

Eventually when ExtPlane does a new v2 release with binari builds, this 
repo will no longer be needed.
